Hey, I'm Kanayo Justice Kenechukwu ✌ 
I work as a front-end developer with UI/UX design skills (front-end designer). I'm based in Lagos, Nigeria.

Since 2017 I've been living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to
immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little belmr through design & code. 😍❤
   
    "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs
    
I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm playing musical instruments and studying languages or simply reading
a good book.

Currently improving my React & Python skills, furthering my desires to learning Artificial Intelligence.
